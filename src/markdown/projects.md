# Personal projects

---

## History

I studied mainly backend development, and only in 2021, I started to gain an interest in frontend development.  
I first started out with React, but I switched to Angular for my job and I decided to focus on that. My first projects,  
were in React, and since then I have worked on few Angular projects such as this one.

## This project

I made this portfolio project as an upgrade to my previous portfolio which is found below in the list of projects.  
I created this portfolio using best practices, and utilising a `CI/CD` pipeline. I use git pre-commit hooks,  
for linting and `formatting`. I use a `multi-stage github action` yaml pipeline for `testing`, `building` and `releasing` this project.

# Profile üë®‚ÄçüöÄ

I ‚ù§Ô∏è programming, and I made this portfolio to keep track of my progress.
I plan to keep it up to date, and also create a blog where I will write about
projects or implementations that I have done.

I currently work as a full stack software developer, using Angular and mainly the microsoft stack,
.Net core, Azure and MSSQL. When developing my own projects, I try to use different technologies aswell.

I really like Angular on the frontend, because of its architecture. The modular design sits really well with me,
and it enforces a lot of good coding principles. I have tried a few backend frameworks, and I quite like .Net, but
if I want a nodejs backend, then NestJs has definitely been my favourite for its strong similarity with Angular. I am
also very interested in the cloud, and CI/CD pipelines.

On a personal note, I love dogs. I enjoy doing all kinds of sports, mainly football. I also find it important
to spend time with friends.

```typescript
import * from './example';

export class Profile {
    public interests = ['üíª', 'üê∂', '‚öΩ', 'üéâ', 'üçó'];
}


```
